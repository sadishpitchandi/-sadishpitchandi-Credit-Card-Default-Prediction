Problem Statement:
        Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the
        incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the
        biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The
        goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's
        characteristics and payment history.


Based on the financial capability of a client, they get a credit limit, i.e., the maximum amount they can spend in a month through a credit card.

The credit card companies maintain comprehensive data about each of their clients. By analysing the data, they can know what would be the maximum amount they won't be able to recover from their clients yet able to make a significant profit in a financial year to run a sustainable business.
